Please analyze the project {repo_name} and perform two tasks:

TASK 1: List the most relevant files(no more than 20) for setting up a development environment, including:
0. CI/CD configuration files (such as .github/workflows/*.yml, .gitlab-ci.yml, .travis.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.)
1. README files
2. Documentation files  
3. Installation guides
4. Development setup guides
5. Requirements and dependency files (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml, Pipfile, etc.)
6. Configuration files (.python-version, .nvmrc, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.)

Save the file list to a JSON file named "{setup_files}" in the project root directory.
Format the file list as a JSON array where each element is a string containing the relative path (relative to project root).
Example format: ["README.md", "requirements.txt", "setup.py", ".github/workflows/ci.yml"]

TASK 2: Analyze the configuration files you found and determine the most appropriate Python version for this project.
Based on your analysis, save the recommended Python version to a text file named "{version_file}" in the project root directory.
The file should contain ONLY the version number in the format "3.xx" (e.g., "3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11").

If no specific version requirements are found, use "{default_version}" as the default.

IMPORTANT: The {version_file} file must contain ONLY the version number, no comments, no explanations, no additional text.

Focus only on identifying files and determining the Python version. Do not attempt to configure the environment yet.

⚠️  CRITICAL FIRST STEP ⚠️
**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE, YOU MUST READ THE {setup_files} FILE IN THE PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY**

Please help me configure the runtime environment for this project.
The project is {repo_name}. You need to verify if it can successfully run the tests of the project. 
You can tolerate a few test cases failures—as long as most tests pass, it's good enough.
Your test command must output detailed pass/fail status for each test item. This is mandatory. For example, with pytest, use the -rA option to get output like:
```
...
PASSED tests/test_resources.py::test_fetch_centromeres
PASSED tests/test_vis.py::test_to_ucsc_colorstring
```

🔴 MANDATORY FIRST STEP 🔴
First, read the **{setup_files} file** in the project root to understand which configuration files are available.
DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT READING THIS FILE FIRST!

Then analyze these files to understand the project structure, dependencies, and requirements.
Install necessary dependencies using system pip3, set up the correct Python environment in the system Python installation, and ensure all required packages are installed so that the test files can run properly using the system Python3.
If the project itself needs to be installed as a package, use 'pip3 install -e'. to install it in editable mode, rather than installing other versions from the network.
Focus on resolving any import errors, missing dependencies, or configuration issues.

IMPORTANT: 
1. This Docker container may have been used to configure environments for the same project at different commits before.
2. If you encounter any testing-related errors (such as 'collected 0 items', 'no tests found', 'skip', 'INTERNALERROR', 
'TypeError: could not get code object', or other pytest framework internal issues), please ignore these errors and focus 
on environment configuration instead. These errors may indicate that test files don't exist, don't contain valid tests, 
or are pytest framework internal issues. In such cases, abandon trying to fix specific test files and continue with 
dependency installation and environment configuration.
3. Do NOT configure the environment in the virtual environment of the agent.
Instead, use the system Python environment. Install all dependencies to the system Python, not in any virtual environment.
4. This Docker container may have been used to configure environments for the same project at different commits before.
Please first check what packages are already installed in the system Python environment to avoid conflicts.
